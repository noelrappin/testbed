Testbed
=======

Testbed lets you create simple one line tests against a common block:

  testbed "call my test function" do |input| 
    subject = MyObject.new(input) 
    subject.method_to_test 
  end 
  verify_that(1).returns("fred") verify_that(2).returns(3)  
  verify_that(2).is_true
  verify_that(3).is_false

The testbed method takes a block. Any verify_that methods attach to the most recently declared testbed, in the same way that a Rake task attaches to the most recently declared desc method. The test names are based on the string argument to the testbed call and the arguments to verify_that.

Note that it's generally better to have literal objects in verify_that and create any ActiveRecord or other objects inside the testbed block
